# daily-schedule

A daily schedule originally designed by Benjamin Franklin, 'forked' by
[Liam Monahan](http://www.monahan.io/blog/2015/10/03/recreating-ben-franklin-s-schedule-in-latex/),
then forked again by Andrew Chambers.

This version was made to help me (Andrew Chambers) maintain good working discipline.
It is modified to somewhat match my existing lifestyle with the addition habits I want to follow but don't currently.

Please feel free to fork it and make your own version.
